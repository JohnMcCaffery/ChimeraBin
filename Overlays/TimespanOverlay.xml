                A longhouse is a long and narrow dwelling 
                commonly found in small clusters in 
                the inland Straths of Sutherland.
              </Subtitle>
              <Subtitle Time="5">
                It is thought that the use of a rectangular building
                plan was influenced by the Vikings, who settled in
                Sutherland in the 9th century AD.
              </Subtitle>
              <Subtitle Time="10">
                It is characterised by having the

              </Subtitle>
              <Subtitle Time="15">
                and a byre for cattle at the other end,

              </Subtitle>

              <Subtitle Time="20">
                The narrowness of these buildings was determined 
                by the limited availability of wood and the 
                need to support a heavy thatched roof.
              </Subtitle>
              <Subtitle Time="25">
                As long as the houses were narrow, there was no restriction 
                on length; in fact some in Kildonan exceed 30m.
              </Subtitle>
              <Subtitle Time="30">
                Most of the longhouses in Kildonan were

                Longhouses commonly have two living areas

                wattle fence of intertwined twigs.
              </Subtitle>

                The living room or ‘cearn’ as it was known in

                The byre was usually designed on a slight slope

                Caen had two corn-drying kilns which were used 
                to dry cereal crops, like oats, to prevent
                rotting or premature germination.

              <Subtitle Time="5">
                This was essential so the grain could 
                be grounds and made into flour.

              <Subtitle Time="10">
                Many kilns were built into the slope of hills,
                with a stone-lined bowl at one end
                and a place for a fire at the other end.

                The grain would have been laid

              <Subtitle Time="20">
                The smoke from a fire at the other end of the kiln 
                travelled up a flue and entered the bottom of the 
                bowl and up to the grain, eventually drying it.

                Rig and furrow cultivation appears as a
